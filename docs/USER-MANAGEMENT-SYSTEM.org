#+AUTHOR: Asteroid Radio Development Team
#+DATE: 2025-10-26

* Overview

Complete user management system with dedicated admin interface, user creation, role management, and comprehensive API endpoints.

* What Was Completed

** User Management Page
- Created dedicated =/admin/users= route
- Separate page from main admin dashboard
- Clean, organized interface for user administration

** Features Implemented

*** User Creation
- Inline user creation form
- Fields: username, email, password, role
- Real-time validation
- Success/error messaging

*** User Display
- List all users with key information
- Shows: username, email, role, status, creation date
- Clean table layout with proper formatting

*** User Statistics
- Total user count
- Active/inactive breakdown
- Role distribution

*** Role Management
- Listener role (default)
- DJ role (content creators)
- Admin role (full access)

*** User Actions
- Activate/deactivate users
- Role assignment
- User deletion (future enhancement)

** API Endpoints

*** GET /api/users
Returns all users in the system
#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "status": "success",
  "users": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "username": "admin",
      "email": "admin@asteroid.radio",
      "role": "admin",
      "active": true,
      "created-date": 1759214069
    }
  ]
}
#+END_SRC

*** GET /api/users/stats
Returns user statistics
#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "status": "success",
  "total-users": 6,
  "active-users": 6,
  "roles": {
    "admin": 2,
    "listener": 4
  }
}
#+END_SRC

*** POST /api/users/create
Creates a new user (requires admin authentication)
#+BEGIN_SRC
POST /asteroid/api/users/create
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=newuser&email=user@example.com&password=pass123&role=listener
#+END_SRC

** Files Created/Modified

*** New Files
- =template/users.chtml= - User management template
- =test-user-api.sh= - API testing script

*** Modified Files
- =asteroid.lisp= - Added user management routes
- =auth-routes.lisp= - Enhanced authentication
- =user-management.lisp= - Core user functions

* Technical Implementation

** Authentication & Authorization
- Requires admin role for user management
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

** Database Schema
Users stored in USERS collection with fields:
- =_id= - Unique identifier
- =username= - Unique username
- =email= - Email address
- =password-hash= - Bcrypt hashed password
- =role= - User role (listener/DJ/admin)
- =active= - Active status (boolean)
- =created-date= - Unix timestamp
- =last-login= - Unix timestamp

** Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management
- CSRF protection (via Radiance)
- Role-based access control

* Testing

** API Testing Script
Created =test-user-api.sh= for comprehensive testing:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Test user statistics
curl -s http://localhost:8080/asteroid/api/users/stats | jq .

# Test user creation (with authentication)
curl -s -b cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:8080/asteroid/api/users/create \
  -d "username=testuser" \
  -d "email=test@example.com" \
  -d "password=testpass123" \
  -d "role=listener" | jq .
#+END_SRC

** Test Results
- ✅ All API endpoints working
- ✅ User creation successful
- ✅ Authentication working
- ✅ Role assignment working
- ✅ 6 users created and tested

* Usage

** Creating a User
1. Navigate to =/asteroid/admin/users=

5. User appears in the list immediately

** Managing Users
1. View all users in the table
2. See user details (email, role, status)

* Status: ✅ COMPLETE

User management system fully functional and production-ready. All core features implemented and tested.
