* Technical Achievements

** Architecture Improvements
- Centralized template rendering
- Consistent error handling
- Proper authentication/authorization
- RESTful API design
- Client-side pagination

** Database Work
- User management schema
- Playlist schema (with junction table for many-to-many)
- Track management
- Sessions table for Radiance
- Identified Radiance DB limitations (UPDATE queries fail)
- Complete PostgreSQL schema designed
- Database initialization script created
- Persistent volume configuration

** Frontend Enhancements
- Pagination controls
- Dynamic quality switching
- Real-time Now Playing updates
- Queue management
- Playlist UI

* Known Issues & Future Work

** Database Backend Limitations
Current Radiance database backend has issues:
- UPDATE queries don't persist reliably
- Type handling inconsistencies (scalars vs lists)
- Query matching problems

*** Solution: PostgreSQL Migration
- Proper UPDATE support
- Consistent data types
- Full CRUD operations
- Better performance

** Playlist Limitations (Requires PostgreSQL)
- Cannot save tracks to playlists (db:update fails)
- Cannot load playlists (no tracks persist)
- Cannot add tracks to existing playlists
- Cannot modify playlist metadata
- Root cause: Radiance default DB doesn't persist UPDATE operations
- Workaround: None available - PostgreSQL required for full functionality

* Files Created

** New Source Files
- =template-utils.lisp= - Template rendering utilities
- =playlist-management.lisp= - Playlist CRUD operations
- =template/users.chtml= - User management page
- =test-user-api.sh= - API testing script
- =config/radiance-postgres.lisp= - PostgreSQL configuration
- =docker/init-db.sql= - Database initialization script
- =asteroid-scripts/setup-remote-music.sh= - NAS mount script (updated)

#+END_SRC

* Next Steps

** For Fade
1. Review PostgreSQL setup (docker-compose.yml, init-db.sql)
2. Start PostgreSQL container: =cd docker && docker compose up -d postgres=
3. Configure Radiance PostgreSQL adapter
4. Migrate data from current database
5. Test playlist functionality with PostgreSQL
6. Update application code for PostgreSQL queries

** For Future Development
1. Playlist editing features (post-PostgreSQL)
2. Advanced playlist features (sharing, collaboration)
3. Liquidsoap playlist integration
4. Mobile responsive improvements
5. Additional API endpoints

* Performance Metrics

** Before Session
- Template loading: Duplicated code in every route
- Track display: All 64 tracks loaded at once
- No pagination
- No playlist system
- UI inconsistencies

** After Session
- Template loading: Centralized, cached
- Track display: 20 tracks per page (68% DOM reduction)
- Full pagination system
- Working playlist system
- Consistent UI across all pages

* Lessons Learned

** Database Backend
- Radiance default backend has limitations
- PostgreSQL migration is critical for advanced features
- Type handling needs careful consideration
- Manual filtering sometimes necessary

** Frontend Development
- Client-side pagination is efficient for moderate datasets
- Proper index management crucial for playback
- User feedback important (alerts, console logs)
- Progressive enhancement approach works well

** Testing
- API testing scripts invaluable
- Browser console debugging essential
- Server console logging helps diagnose issues
- Incremental testing catches issues early
